KCD Content and Programing
---

High quality content, speakers and talk topics will determine event success. First and foremost, all organizers shall follow CNCF vendor nuetral values, which means:

Vendor neutrality in the context of a conference session refers to the principle of maintaining an impartial and unbiased environment during the session, particularly when discussing products, services, or solutions offered by different vendors. The goal is to ensure that the content presented is free from any undue influence, endorsements, or promotional activities related to specific vendors.

By adhering to the concept of vendor neutrality it fosters an environment where knowledge sharing and learning take precedence over commercial interests, benefiting both attendees and the broader industry.


Some basic guidelines for building a good event program include:
* Encourage bold, innovative thought-provoking subjects
* Recruit a diverse slate of speakers (example: not all men)
* Make sure one organization does not receive too many speaking slots
* Make sure that all content is sensitive and appropriate
* Promote fun and participation
* Encourage interaction between attendees
* Specify what languages are acceptable for talks


## Recruiting Speakers

Along with sponsorships, this is one of the most challenging parts of running an event. The [CNCF Speakers Bureau](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2020/01/31/cncf-speakers-bureau-a-great-resource/)  is a great place to start. Regardless you should anticipate spending some time recruiting speakers and speaking proposals.  With this in mind, here are some ways to make recruiting speakers easier:

* Build a stock of proposal ideas for potential speakers either to adopt or use to spark their creative process
* Offer to brainstorm with potential speakers to help create content
* Reach out to known event speakers on the CNCF Slack and ask if they have speaking ideas (or if they want to speak at the event!)
* [Here is a playbook](https://sessionize.com/playbook/tips-for-new-speakers) you can share that shows you how to submit an application via Sessionize.

Recruiting a diverse speaker slate requires extra effort. Some ideas for this include:
* Kubernetes Community Days prohibits all male panels. Please plan to have a minimum of two women speakers on a panel. This ensures if there is a cancellation you will have gender diversity.
* Contact organizations like [Women Who Code](https://www.womenwhocode.com/) and [Black Girls Code](http://www.blackgirlscode.com/)
* Check relevant meetups for past speakers
* Consider bringing in speakers from outside the region to improve diversity
* Make sure you have two female speakers on each panel
* Give speakers at least six weeks of notice so they can make travel arrangements

## Judging proposals

* Announce your “Call For Proposals” early to give speakers and your team the most time to find quality speakers and content ideas
* Minimize bias, by creating a transparent proposal rating system
* List proposal rating criteria (e.g. originality, big idea, new speaker, high-quality speaker) 
* Have a panel of judges award each proposal points against each criteria
* Add up the points and award the speaking slot to the highest rated proposals
* Publish the names of the programming committee
* Be prepared to explain any programming decisions

## Content considerations

* Give higher priority to content that has not been previously presented 
* Try for a good balance between local and out-of-town speakers
* Prioritize new event speakers: Kubernetes Community Days is a supportive environment to encourage new voices in our space

## Set up a clear timeline on content reviews

* Regularly check-in with speakers to ensure they are making progress
* Offer content development assistance and presentation coaching
* Review every presentation in advance to ensure appropriate content
* Schedule at least two live video run-throughs of presentations before the event
 * Identify all A/V requirements for each presentation
 * Do they need video playback?
 * Live coding?
 * Preferred microphone types?
* Check in with all speakers on event day to make sure they are ready
* Provide constructive post-event feedback with concrete advice

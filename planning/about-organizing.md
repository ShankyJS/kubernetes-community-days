## About Kubernetes Community Days

Kubernetes Community Days (KCDs) are community-organized events that gather adopters and technologists from open source and cloud native communities for education, collaboration, and networking. KCDs are supported by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io) (CNCF). These fun, locally-defined events help grow and sustain the Kubernetes community.

We'd like to thank [DevOpsDays](https://devopsdays.org) and [OpenStack Days](https://www.openstack.org/community/events/openstackdays) for providing some of the core ideas and content for this document.

KCDs can be in person, virtual, or hybrid. In person is strongly encouraged when possible. Virtual events are run on the [Cloud Native Community Groups](https://community.cncf.io/) platform, powered by [Bevy](https://www.bevy.com/). 

## Interested in Hosting a Kubernetes Community Day?

Any city or region can host a Kubernetes Community Day. Each local KCD event team handles its own sponsorships, registration, and logistics. Check if there is a KCD event scheduled in your area on the [issue board](https://github.com/cncf/kubernetes-community-days/projects/2). If there *is* already an event scheduled, you can reach out to the organizers and offer to help. The CNCF supports KCDs with guidance and event promotion via CNCF newsletters, blog posts, and social media channels.

This quick start guide covers all aspects of holding a successful event. Please keep in mind that Kubernetes Community Days are:

* **Primarily for community engagement**. Organizers and speakers must avoid vendor pitches.
* **Inclusive**. Organizers must make reasonable efforts to work with others, regardless of their organizational affiliation.

## Timeline

Here is a [planning timeline](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bvCiyyDut1seSnBE6pzVevcJkXLeWbxbncvhFsyY8PI/edit#gid=0) you can review, then make a copy and edit. We have noted aspects that are for in-person events vs online only.

## Assembling Your Team

The first step towards a successful event is building a team. Look for potential team members in local user groups and Meetups, such as the [CNCF Community Groups](https://community.cncf.io/), or online in the public Kubernetes slack or other related online communities.

Check the GitHub Kubernetes Community Days [issue board](https://github.com/cncf/kubernetes-community-days/projects/2) to see if others have expressed interest in organizing an event in your area. If there are no issues for your area, create an issue asking if others are interested in organizing an event with you. After your team is assembled, we encourage you to have regular meetings for planning purposes. If you would like to record your meetings or need a conference line, CNCF can provide a Zoom URL. Please contact a Core Organizer for access or to learn more.

We have been fortunate to naturally have all KCD teams include at least 1 non-male organizer. We highly encourage all our programs to be inclusive for speakers, and attendees, and this starts with your organizers/program committee.

We recommend assigning the following responsibilities to one or two members of your organizing team:

* [Finance and budgeting](/planning/budget-finances.md)
* [Marketing and promotion](/planning/marketing-promotion.md) 
* [Sponsors](/sponsor-resources/sponsorships-faq.md)
* [Call for Proposals (CFP) and schedule](/speaker-resources/cfp.md)
* Website & Design Team: You might have 1-2 people assigned to this/these role(s)
* [Registration](/planning/registration.md)
* Event Planner: Venue, catering, local activities, and the hotel
* Swag: T-shirts, stickers and other giveaways
* Ancilary Logistics: Evening events for example

## Getting Started Checklist

Once you have found and organized your team of a minimum of three people, and can [meet these terms](https://github.com/cncf/kubernetes-community-days/blob/main/README.md#terms), it it time to start planning!

Once your team meets the above-linked criteria, you may submit an application during the open call for KCDs (typically 6 months before the year of application). Once your application has been approved, and you had a kick-off call with a core CNCF Staff member, the organization can begin! 

Your organizing team will be invited to a private Slack channel where you can connect with other global KCD organizers. At this time, CNCF will set up monthly syncs with you, grant access to designated tools and create an email alias for your team. You can then begin creating your website and the Bevy event platform via a chapter CNCF will designate to you. 

* Where our standard tools are blocked, CNCF will work with KCD organizers to determine alternatives. 

** For the launch, we want to ensure that each KCD is successful. Part of ensuring the success of the event is to have the first 3 sponsors committed, one of which will be CNCF. We acknowledge requiring KCD Organizers to have 3 sponsors committed prior to the approval of your event can be challenging, but this ensures you can financially support your venue with secured dates that you promise to the community.

## Event Details 

Events may be developer-focused or they can cover, business issues, cloud strategy, and community efforts in the cloud native ecosystem. Attendance averages 150-500 people. Most start small and grow slowly, including 1 days versus 2 days. KCDs are not to be used for commercial pitches. Any platforms or tools your content teaches about, are describing the need to be open source. That said, the majority of your content should be about how companies rely on open source technologies to improve their processes.

We aim to help your event break even in costs, but if your event makes a profit, that must be reinvested in the community. Organizers can be reimbursed for event-related expenses reimbursed, but not their time.

Other considerations:

* Encourage bold, innovative, thought-provoking subjects
* Events typically host at least four 30-minute talks per day
* Open space sessions are generated, voted on and scheduled during the conference - not ahead of time.
* The event must be at least one day long
* Lower prices for early-bird registration are recommended
* Registration and sponsorship needs to be available to anyone, until available capacity sells out
* Encourage interaction and think about ways to create this
* The attendee list may not be used for commercial or marketing purposes. It may only be used to advertise that specific Kubernetes Community Day or further iterations of it. The list may not be shared with third parties who are not directly involved in organizing the event. Please review the [Privacy Policy Statement](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/privacy/).
* Sponsors are allowed to collect attendee information at their tables. 

## Logos and Trademarks

Once your event and name have been accepted, you are authorized by CNCF to use that name (e.g., KCD Bouvet Island). Please design a custom logo to be paired with the [official KCD logo](https://github.com/cncf/artwork/blob/main/examples/other.md#kubernetes-community-days) (reach out to kcd@cncf.io for guidelines) for your event. **The logo is not permitted to include the Kubernetes Wheel (in whole or in part).** The event logo must include the event name. You are welcome to include the CNCF logo in your event logo and graphics; youâ€™re also welcome to use [Phippy](https://phippy.io/) and friends (high-res versions available in the artwork [repo](https://github.com/cncf/artwork/blob/master/examples/other.md#phippy--friends-group-logos).

Please send your logo in SVG format, to kcd@cncf.io for approval, OR if you need desigg help, we are happy to offer the LF Creative team to assist.

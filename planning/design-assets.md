### Design Assets for Your KCD

KCDs have graphics from online social media, header images, logos ([see logo guidelines](https://github.com/cncf/kubernetes-community-days/blob/main/planning/your-logo.md)), badges, and pop-up banners on-site.

Please refer to [other design graphics](https://github.com/cncf/kubernetes-community-days/blob/main/templates.md) that live within the templates section of this repository.

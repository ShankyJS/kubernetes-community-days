# KCD Logo Use

Starting in 2024, all KCDs must have unity with [the new logo](https://github.com/cncf/artwork/blob/main/examples/other.md#kubernetes-community-days) (created in 2023).

Please work with Audra Montenegro to submit your request with the Linux Foundation Creative team. Or if you have design resources, please use the above-linked logo at the base of yours (like the olympics), and submit for review to kcd@cncf.io.

[Here are some examples of other KCD logos this year so far.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1g4AvMvLqNPDVCIHXviuQge8-uFXyKv4y?usp=sharing)

The city must be respresented in the naming convention of your KCD with the following in mind. Please work with Audra for any exceptions.
* The size of the country you reside in
* The distance traveled to a KCD within the same country

Please refer to [other design graphics](https://github.com/cncf/kubernetes-community-days/blob/main/templates.md) that live within the templates section of this repository.
